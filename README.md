Library Management System (Using OOP)

The Library Management System is a Java-based console application that helps manage books, users, and library records. It allows users to add books, register users, borrow/return books, and keep track of the library’s collection efficiently.

This project demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects, constructors, encapsulation, and methods in Java.

Features:-
Book Management – Add, view, and manage books.
User Management – Register and manage library users.
Borrow & Return – Users can borrow and return books.
Library Records – Track available and borrowed books.
Simple & Extendable – Easy to understand and expand.
